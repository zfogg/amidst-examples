      Our API gives developers unprecedented access to users' interactions in the
      real world. The Index.io mobile SDK figures out when two people come in close
      contact.
    p.
      Because it uses low-energy Bluetooth to accomplish this, our SDK will
      work even while your user's phone is locked and in their pocket, and even
      while your app is in the background. Our SDK report geo-tagged meeting
      information to our API. Index.io takes those meetings, along with the
      meetings from the rest of the apps on our API, and builds a social graph
      with them.
    p.
      For example, what if I forget to exchange contact information with people here
      at LAUNCH hackathon before I go home? Twitter app developers could
      easily ask the Index.io API "who was @zfogg near in the last 48 hours?",
      and they would receive a list of users that @zfogg probably wants to follow.
    p.
      Smaller apps can also benefit from our API! Once a new app joins our API network,
      they gain access to the entire history of our social graph, and they can use that
      data for things like initial contact-onboarding, making their app's newsfeeds more
      relevant, and much more!
    p.
      Location-based games, match-making services, contact-exchanges . . . the
      possibilities are endless! Index.io is very excited to see how our API users
      will take advantage of this never-before-seen dataset.
